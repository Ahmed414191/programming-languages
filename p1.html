Programming language: It is a set of commands written according to specific rules by the programming language. Then, these commands go through several stages until they are executed on the computer. Each programming language contains a set of special words in addition to a specific method of writing that determines how to organize program commands. There are many types of programming languages, and many are produced every year. Among the popular programming languages (HTML, PHP, CSS, XML, JAVASCRIPT). Each language was classified and level based on its proximity to human languages. Whereas, the programming language close to human languages is classified as high-level, while the programming language that is far from human languages is classified as low-level. The first high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalk√ºl, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945.
